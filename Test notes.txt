I'm testing capabilities  of 6 AI engine versions  4 companies  plus double versions of 2

This test involves taking a previously written webpage, the green page, and making a bunch of changes.

I'm familiar with Open AI's capabilities  on both it's pay and Free ChatGPT 4.0
Both could easily handle this coding task so I did not try them. 
The original page was by them.

Copilot-  off of Google  -  didn't see a way to enter a prior written  file.
but this is my goto now for simple stupid questions. ie What was Hannibals hair color?

Copilot by icon  - no paperclip - asked got response copy included

Claude -   found it not a good as my other choices in the past, skipping it

GROK now free, no  paperclip but was able to handle entry of the original file as a cut and paste,
and then the instruction on the next entry

Total time involved for GROK  was seconds.
Total time for me to think this up, write out my spec on notepad, generate the code test it and upload my results to GitHub might be a hour.  

It produced the blue page in one run and it works great. Thanks Elon
