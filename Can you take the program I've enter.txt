Can you take the program I've entered at the paperclip and 
make some changes.

It functions as a language learning drill in few phrases in  a number of languages. 


Change the color theme from a green to a blue.


Change the title
"Elevator Conversation"

to "Casual Conversation bits"


Change the lines 


"In English, you would say, "Hello, how are you?"

to 
"Hello, Thanks, Please and Goodbye"

change the phrases it drills in to those phases including phonetics.

Drop Korean as a language. Add Ukrainian and Afrikaans languages and all their functionality  under the new rules
